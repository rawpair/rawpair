# Trademark Policy

**RawPair™** is a trademark of Andrea Mancuso.

This trademark applies to the name "RawPair", the RawPair logo (if any), and any branding or representation that could reasonably be confused with the official RawPair project.

The RawPair source code is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)](./LICENSE), and you are free to use, modify, and redistribute the code under the terms of that license.

However, the RawPair™ name and associated marks are **not** covered by the MPL license. You may not use the RawPair™ name or logo:

- As the name of a forked project
- In modified versions that are distributed to others
- In domain names, company names, or product names
- In a way that misrepresents your project as the official RawPair

### You *can*:
- Fork and modify RawPair for your own use
- Create new projects inspired by RawPair
- Mention RawPair by name when referring to the upstream project

### You *can't*:
- Call your fork or product "RawPair" without written permission
- Use the name or logo in promotional material for a competing service
- Mislead users into thinking your project is affiliated with RawPair

### Why this exists

The trademark helps protect users from confusion and keeps the RawPair identity consistent. We welcome contributions, forks, and experimentation - we just ask that the **name "RawPair" remains tied to the official project**.

If you have questions or want to request permission, [open an issue](https://github.com/rawpair/rawpair/issues) or contact Andrea directly.

Use the code freely under MPL 2.0.  
Use the name responsibly.  
Don't pretend to be us.
